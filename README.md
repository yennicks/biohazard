# Biohazard ☣️
Biohazard is a yet another static site generator that aims to produce simple but effective bio and link pages.

## Introduction
The idea is derived from the linkpages that instafamous persons use.
There are however, some hazards in putting all your trust in commercial sites that manage these simple websites for you.

Biohazard wants to serve as an alternative to the *hazardous* trend of trusting your *biography* to commercial companies.

## Roadmap
This project is currently in a proof of concept phase.
A roadmap will be presented when it reaches an alpha phase and the project will continue.
